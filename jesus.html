                <p>First, you must understand your need for a personal Saviour. The Bible is very clear that we all have a huge problem called sin. Romans 3:23 says it this way, “For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.” This verse simply means that none of us are sinless. We are guilty of violating God’s Law. You might not be the worst sinner, but the best sinner still needs a Saviour. Are you willing to confess your guilt to God?</p>

                <p>The problem is this – sin has a high price tag. Romans 6:23a says, “For the wages of sin is death…” In other words, the price for sin is eternal death apart from God in a place called Hell – not a good thing! Because of our sin, we are all condemned before God and none of us can make it into Heaven on our own. It doen’t matter if we deny our sinfulnes, God already knows the state of our heart.</p>

                <p>Here’s the good news – God sent help! The rest of Romans 6:23 says, “…but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Again in Romans 5;8 God says, “But God commendeth His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us!” this leads us to the second step.</p>

                <p>You must repent (turn from your sin) and believe on Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour! Jesus Christ came to earth as God in the flesh, lived a perfect life, and then voluntarily died on a cross taking your punishment because He loves you. In His death, He literally paid for all of your sins. After three days, Jesus rose from the dead and is coming back again someday. He wants to be your Saviour! The Bible promises in Romans 10:13, that all those who “call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.” The stakes are high. If you truely trust Christ, He will change your life and give you a home in Heaven. To postpone or reject is to remain under the condemnation of sin. Will you pray and claim Christ as your Saviour today?</p>

                <p>One day everyone will accept the truth of Who Jesus is. But for many it will be too late because they refused to accept Him by faith. You can wait until you stand before God and are confronted with the fact of the Lordship of Jesus Christ, but you will only be saved if you have accepted it by faith before that time. Today is the day of Salvation. Php 2:10-11 tells us, “That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” When confronted with the fact of His Lordship, it will be too late for faith.</p>

                <p>Saving faith is simply this. Accepting my guilt before God for my sin. Accepting Christ’s death was in my place. Turning from all else and trusting Him alone for forgiveness and cleansing. Beginning a new relationship with Jesus as my Lord. Pray and sincerely confess these things to the Lord in faith.</p>
